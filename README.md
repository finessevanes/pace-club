# Pace Club

Pace Club is a web3 social app for women runners to find, connect, and build community with others who match their pace and vibe. It uses on-chain profiles, real-world activity verification, and privacy-preserving identity checks.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (deployed on Celo and Flow EVM testnet)
- **Web3 Libraries:** ethers.js, @privy-io/react-auth, Self Protocol SDKs
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (for Strava OAuth and web2 attestation)
- **Other:** Strava API for activity verification

## Key Features

### Self Protocol for Gender Verification
Users must verify their gender as female using the Self protocol, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to keep sensitive data private. This is enforced both in the UI and on-chain (see `ProofOfHuman.sol`).

### On-Chain Profiles on Flow
User running profiles (pace, vibe, location, bio) are written to the Flow EVM testnet via the `VibeProfile` contract. This enables decentralized, tamper-proof social data and rewards for real-world meetups.

### Strava Integration
Users connect their Strava account. The app fetches and verifies running activities, which are used as proof for real-world meetups and to claim on-chain rewards.

### Honorable Mention â€“ Flare
The project explored using Flare for web2 data attestation, but due to local development URLs not being publicly accessible, this integration could not be deployed in time.
